## what is this?
a chrome extension for converting dates between timezones and creating calendar appointments.

## why?

flying to america soon and it's a real pain to keep converting between PDT and AEST ...

## Description!

Highlight the appointment date. Change timezones. Create calendar appointment. 

It's as easy as that. 

CalZone uses Natural Language Processing technology to extract the text that you select on your browser, and converts it into actual, numeric dates. You can highlight text such as '3 weeks ago' or '21st of August' or 'Tomorrow' - Calzone will be able to recognise human readable date strings, convert such strings into ANY timezone, before allowing the user to create an appointment on their calendar.
